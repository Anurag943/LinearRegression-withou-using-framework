**Linear Regression Implementation From Scratch**

This project implements linear regression without relying on external frameworks like scikit-learn. It utilizes NumPy and Pandas for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation, and showcases the fundamental workings of gradient descent optimization.

## Project Overview

This code demonstrates the basic steps of linear regression, including:

* **Data loading and preparation:** Employing Pandas to load data from CSV or similar data sources.
* **Model definition:** Representing the linear regression model as `y = wx + b`, where `w` is the weight and `b` is the bias.
* **Cost function:** Implementing the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function to measure the model's performance.
* **Gradient descent optimization:** Building a custom gradient descent optimizer from scratch, including calculation of the gradient and parameter updates.
* **Model evaluation:** Computing metrics like mean squared error and R-squared to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Dependencies

* NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
* Pandas (`pip install pandas`)


**Key features include:**

- Clear code organization with descriptive function names and comments.
- Modular structure for easier understanding and modification.
- Docstrings for better documentation within the code itself.
